# hello-world
My first Repository

Hi all,

I started my journey as a system configuration analyst and performed 2 years in that role. Then I spent about 3 years as a business analyst. And then enjoyed actuarial science for over 6 years before moving into financial and operational engineering in an extremely entrepreneurial and innovative firm owned by an intelligent billionare.

Also, I enjoy playing games with my daughter, having conversations with my wife, discussing & working on business ideas with my colleague, visiting Mexico, eating grilled fish at a mediteranean restaruant by mediteranean coast, practicing muay thai, playing Assasin's Creed, reading National Geography, and lately coding in Python in the name of Data Science.

Thank you for taking the time to read and get to know about me.

My best,
Atahan Kocak
